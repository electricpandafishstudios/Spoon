T-Engine is distributed with the following software implementation of OpenAL:
OpenAL Soft: http://kcat.strangesoft.net/openal.html

  If you would like to use your system's OpenAL implementation instead, simply 
delete or rename the OpenAL32.dll file in your T-Engine directory.  If T-Engine 
refuses to run after renaming or deleting this file, your system does not
provide an OpenAL implementation and you must use the OpenAL32.dll provided
in the T-Engine distribution.
